00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:10,440
Today I will talk about the 1.1.1 criterion of web content Accessibility

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,380
which concerns non-textual content

3
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:24,120
before going into specifics and understanding what this criterion is about

4
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,260
you must first understand what the non-textual content is

5
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:33,260
in fact, non-textual content concerns all the content within a web page

6
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,260
which is presented to the user and has a text alternative

7
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,940
and that has a textual alternative that fulfills the equivalent purpose

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,740
there are several specific types of non-textual content

9
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,180
for example the illustrative photos

10
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,840
which are simply images of objects, people or places

11
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,980
of background images

12
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,360
which are obtained using CSS

13
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,720
and therefore it is not possible to specify an alternate text value

14
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:10,040
however it is important to use an alternate background for cases where the image

15
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,200
cannot be displayed

16
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,500
icons

17
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:22,740
they are small pictograms, images that convey specific information

18
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:29,000
and obviously they must be used consistently, within a page or site

19
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,580
charts and diagrams

20
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,960
they usually represent numerical data

21
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,980
consequently a possible alternative text could consist

22
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,260
in a brief summary of the main trends

23
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:50,560
or if necessary, provide a more detailed description of the text

24
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:55,100
using the description field in the advanced image properties tab

25
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,980
captcha

26
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:03,560
captcha stands for "Fully automated turing test to distinguish machines from people

27
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:08,220
and is usually used as a security check on web pages

28
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,580
to distinguish humans from malicious software

29
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,520
which, however, can represent an obstacle to accessibility

30
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,000
in fact, these are images that require users to describe what they see

31
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,060
in order to pass a safety test

32
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,860
therefore providing alternative text for the image is obviously not possible

33
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,260
and alternative solutions will need to be considered

34
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,300
the purpose of the non-textual content

35
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:44,100
information on a web page can be provided in various non-textual formats

36
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,000
such as images, videos and animations

37
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,720
however blind people

38
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,400
or with severe visual impairment they are unable to see non-textual content

39
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,840
but they can still access the textual content

40
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,940
read using a screen reader

41
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,700
or presented in tactile form by a braille device

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,220
so thanks to the availability of textual alternatives to the content

43
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,920
all people can access the site

44
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,600
how to meet the criterion

45
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,360
for graphic and static elements the basic requirement is

46
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,800
in providing an equivalent text alternative

47
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,100
and this can be done in the ALT text

48
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,440
and then make small descriptions about the image

49
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,860
now let's go and see

50
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:45,320
here we have a normal site with images

51
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,740
that have already incorporated some small descriptions

52
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,480
very detailed but that center the lens of the photo

53
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,040
though if we notice the code

54
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,800
nothing has been specified for the ALT text

55
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,420
so, here for example I am talking about our residences

56
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,020
let's put "residence" at the ALT attribute

57
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:19,560
and so on for all ALT tags

58
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,240
so here we talk about ski areas

59
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,140
to the ALT tag we can put "districts"

60
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,640
here we have our territory, we can put "territory"

61
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,980
and so on

62
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,960
this mechanism must be done for all ALT attributes

63
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,740
creating good text alternatives

64
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,400
then there are various forms of non-textual content

65
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,620
hence the value of the alt text

66
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,900
depends on the role of the graphic on the page

67
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,820
textual alternatives should be concise

68
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,740
but clearly convey essential information

69
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,140
provided by non-textual content
